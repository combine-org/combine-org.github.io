# COMBINE coordination

## COMBINE coordinator meetings

The global COMBINE effort is led by the COMBINE Coordination Board which meets regularly. The notes of the meetings are made public:

## COMBINE procedures

### Becoming a COMBINE standard
A pipeline has nevertheless emerged for the inclusion of new standards in the set of COMBINE standards. We intend to formalize it into a SOP. Meanwhile here is a short informal description of the procedure.

A community wanting to add a new description format to the COMBINE set should start by having it listed as a [related or associated standard](https://co.mbine.org/standards/#associated-standards). The developers should join the COMBINE community, and in particular participate to the [annual COMBINE meetings](https://co.mbine.org/events).

COMBINE aims to develop a set of robust interoperable and non-overlapping standards. Candidate standardization efforts must therefore comply a series of criteria:

The aim of COMBINE is to help foster the development of a set of open, interoperable and non-overlapping standards in systems biology. In order to be included in the set of COMBINE standards, an effort must, at a minimum, fulfill the following criteria:

* The standard must cover aspects of modeling in biology that are significantly different from those already catered for by the existing set of COMBINE standards. This includes, but is not limited to, covering different modeling approaches, different biological scales or biological entities, different types of representations.
The standards must be described in technical specification documents as well as, when appropriate, formal specification languages (for instance, but not solely, XML Schemas, UML diagrams, and so on). The technical specifications must be precise enough to allow certifiable software support.
* The specifications and other materials describing the specifications (including, for instance, XML Schemas and UML diagrams) must be publicly available free of charge to everyone and be unencumbered by licensing restrictions. If a specification material is covered by a license, it should allow use and redistribution by anyone. And example of a suitable license would be the creative commons with attribution.
* The development of the standard must be open. The entire COMBINE community must be able to participate without exclusion. Proper ways of communication, must ensure that the community can express needs, criticisms and suggestions about all aspects of the standards. Examples include open development mailing lists with open archives, open source code repository, open website (no password protection).
* The standard must be developed and used by more than a single team or organisation.
The development process must be led by editorial boards comprised of democratically elected members, possibly assisted by expert committees nominated by the editorial boards.
* There must exist a mature software support, including standard API implementations, that facilitates the use of the standard. If possible, validation tools such as test suite, validators, etc., should exist as well.
* The development of the standard must be stable; for instance, it must be supported by established teams and/or reliable funding sources. The standard must be actively developed.

The acceptance of the format as a COMBINE standard is then decided by the [coordinators](https://co.mbine.org/people/).

### COMBINE format specification infrastructure
The activities of COMBINE span several standards. Each standard is described in multiple specification documents. It is important to be able to refer precisely and consistently to a given standard or to its specification. It is also important to access the documents. In order to do so, COMBINE provides a [specification infrastructure](https://github.com/combine-org/combine-specifications). There is also a [list of all specifications](https://github.com/combine-org/combine-specifications/tree/main/specifications).

### Organization of COMBINE meetings
An important activity of COMBINE is to organise common meetings, where the developers of the different standards can meet and work together. If you wish to propose a meeting, or are in the process of setting one up, please read the page [Organization of COMBINE meetings](https://co.mbine.org/author/organizing-a-combine-event/). This document describes the procedures to follow to propose and organize the meetings, defines the respective responsibilities and provides practical advices.

### COMBINE discussions
Some technical discussions launched within the community are of COMBINE-wide interest. They are therefore documented on this website. They may, or may not, result in documents, solutions, technologies, included in the COMBINE procedures. If you want to discuss the goals, organization and operation of COMBINE, subscribe to [combine-discuss](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/combine-discuss).
