Thomas Gorochowski (Ph.D. in Engineering Mathematics) is a Royal Society University Research Fellow and Lecturer at the University of Bristol, UK where he heads up the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biocomputelab.org">Biocompute Lab</a>. His research is focused on better understanding how biological systems process information and exploiting synthetic biology techniques to rationally reprogram living cells with our own desired functions. Since 2016 he has been involved with the SBOL Data and Visual standards and is currently a member of the SBOL Scientific Steering Committee.
