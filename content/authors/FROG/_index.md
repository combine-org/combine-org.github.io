- The [FROG](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/curation/fbc) standard is designed to faithfully reproduce the analysis results of a flux balance model. Flux values are commonly reported as results in manuscripts with flux balance analysis of constraint-based models. These values cannot be used to test the reproducibility as often multiple solutions exist for the same. Hence, numerically reproducible results of the analysis are required to verify the reproducibility of the models. Following the discussion in the HARMONY2020 and COMBINE2020 meetings, we recognized the several outputs/results of the FBA analysis that are numerically reproducible and can be used for curation.
