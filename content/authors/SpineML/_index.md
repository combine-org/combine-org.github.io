- The [Spiking Neural Mark-up Language (SpineML)](https://spineml.github.io/) is a declarative XML based model description language for large scale neural network models. It is partially based upon on the INCF NineML syntax utilising the LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification) common model specification syntax which is proposed to unite a range of INCF supported simulators including NeuroML v2.0 and PyNN.
