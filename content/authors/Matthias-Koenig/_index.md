<p>
<strong>Matthias König</strong> (PhD in Biophysics) is
<strong>Head of the Systems Medicine of the Liver Lab</strong> at
Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Faculty of Life Sciences, Institute of Biology
(ITB), and <strong>Head of the Computational Biomechanics Group</strong> at the
University of Stuttgart, Institute of Structural Mechanics and Dynamics in
Aerospace Engineering.
</p>

<p>
His research focuses on computational modeling, data science, bioinformatics,
and machine learning applied to biological, medical, and clinical data, with a
particular emphasis on predictive and mechanistic models of liver function,
physiology, and drug metabolism.
</p>

<p>
He has been actively involved in the development of community standards and
tools in systems and computational biology, including <strong>SBML</strong>,
<strong>SED-ML</strong>, and software supporting these standards, as well as the
<strong>COMBINE</strong> initiative and the COMBINE Archive. His work strongly
emphasizes reproducibility, interoperability, and FAIR data and modeling
practices.
