The "COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork" (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community <a href="/standards">standards and formats</a> for computational models. By doing so, it is expected that the federated projects will develop a set of interoperable and non-overlapping standards covering all aspects of modeling in biology. The global COMBINE effort is led by the <a href="/people">COMBINE Coordination Board</a>.

Building on the experience of mature projects, which already have stable specifications, software support, user-base and community governance, COMBINE will help foster or support fledgling efforts aimed at filling gaps or new needs. As those efforts mature, they may become part of the <a href="/standards">core set of COMBINE standards</a>.

One of the initial activities of COMBINE is to coordinate the organization of scientific and technical <a href="/events">events</a> common to several standards. Those events, as others related to our field of research are gathered in a calendar.


To discuss the goals, organization and operation of COMBINE, subscribe to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/combine-discuss">COMBINE discuss mailing list</a>.
