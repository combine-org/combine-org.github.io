- The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/KISAO"> Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) </a> describes existing algorithms and their inter-relationships through their characteristics and parameters.  It is updated from its [github repository](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO).

- KiSAO is used in SED-ML, which allows simulation software to automatically choose the best algorithm available to perform a simulation and unambiguously refer to it.
