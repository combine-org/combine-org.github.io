The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://sbml.org"> Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)</a> is a computer-readable <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">  XML format</a> for representing models of biological processes. SBML is suitable for, but not limited to,  models using a process description approach.
