<br/>

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2024 will be held at **University College London**

Local organizers are Sarah Keating (s.keating@ucl.ac.uk) and Padraig Gleeson,  (p.gleeson@ucl.ac.uk).

<h3>Arrival and Transportation</h3>

London is served by [six international airports](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/travel-to-london/airport) and [twelve major stations](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/travel-to-london/trains-to-london) including St. Pancras International, which is the Eurostar hub, with multiple direct connections to Europe.

Travel within London can be done by Tube, Bicycle, Bus, Taxi and more. [More information can be found here](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/getting-around-london).

<h3>Accommodations and meals</h3>

Tea and coffee will be freely available throughout the meeting. In view of the number of people using the building, it may be advisable to bring your own mug!

A sandwich lunch will also be provided - please make sure you give us the correct information as to which days you will be in attendance when you fill in the registration form.

### <a name="visa"></a>Visa

Given that the UK is no longer part of the EU, visa requirements may have changed for you. Please check [here](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa). If you need a letter to support your application, please contact one of the organizers.

Additionally, if you need confirmation that a talk/poster/breakout session will be accepted before the confirmation deadline, please get in contact.

| Chair | Title | Outline of the session | Time | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fengkai Zhang | Demo of Simmune Modeler and Analyzer | We will demonstrate how to create rule-based models using Simmune Modeler and how to explore the parameter space of biological pathways using Simmune Analyzer. We will do our demo on ubuntu 22.04. Virtualbox on windows or intel Mac OS will also be ok for participants to do hand-on practice. Virtualbox file with ubuntu installation will be provided. | TBC | TBC |
| Padraig Gleeson | NeuroML hackathon: convert your neuron and network models to open, standardised, reusable formats | This will be an opportunity for developers of models in computational neuroscience to get an introduction to the aims and structure of NeuroML, a guide to the tools available for building/converting your models to NeuroML, and to receive hands on help with expressing their models (or other published models they are interested in) in NeuroML format, making them more open, accessible and reusable. | Tuesday 9 April | TBC |
