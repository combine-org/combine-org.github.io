<br/>

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2024 will be held at **University College London**

Local organizers are Sarah Keating (s.keating@ucl.ac.uk) and Padraig Gleeson,  (p.gleeson@ucl.ac.uk).
