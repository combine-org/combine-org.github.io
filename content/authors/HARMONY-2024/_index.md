<br/>

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2024 will be held at **University College London**

Local organizers are Sarah Keating (s.keating@ucl.ac.uk) and Padraig Gleeson,  (p.gleeson@ucl.ac.uk).

<h3>Arrival and Transportation</h3>

London is served by [six international airports](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/travel-to-london/airport) and [twelve major stations](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/travel-to-london/trains-to-london) including St. Pancras International, which is the Eurostar hub, with multiple direct connections to Europe.

Travel within London can be done by Tube, Bicycle, Bus, Taxi and more. [More information can be found here](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/getting-around-london).

<h3>Accommodations and meals</h3>

Tea and coffee will be freely available throughout the meeting. In view of the number of people using the building, it may be advisable to bring your own mug!

A sandwich lunch will also be provided - please make sure you give us the correct information as to which days you will be in attendance when you fill in the registration form.
