<br/>

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2026 will be held at the **University of Auckland**.

From 2–12 Feb 2026, the Auckland Bioengineering Institute hosts three workshops in Auckland advancing digital twin modelling, interoperability standards, and clinical translation.

On this page you can find conference accommodation rates, venue and transport information for getting around Auckland, details on the other workshops happening during the same period, information about Waitangi Day — New Zealand’s national holiday, which falls during the meetings; as well as an optional Waiheke Island excursion and plenty of things to do and places to dine around the city.

## Workshop Location

HARMONY 2026 will be held at the University of Auckland. It will be co-located with the <a href="https://www.cardiacphysiome.org/meetings/2026-cardiopulmonary-physiome-workshop/">2026 Cardiopulmonary Physiome Workshop</a>.

The workshop will take place at:

The Faculty of Engineering  (Building 401)
Atrium (Room 418)
20 Symonds Street, Auckland Central.

## Arrival and Transportation

Getting from Auckland Airport (AKL) to the central city (also known as the 'CBD') is straightforward. Your main options depend on your budget, time, and preference for convenience.

#### Quick Comparison Table

| Method                 | Approx. Cost (1 Adult) | Approx. Time | Best For              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Public Transport       | ~$6.50                 | 50 - 60 mins | Budget                |
| Express Bus (SkyDrive) | ~$18                   | 35 - 50 mins | Simplicity & Value    |
| Ride-Share (Uber)      | ~$40 - $65             | 25 - 45 mins | On-Demand Convenience |
| Taxi (Fixed Fare)      | ~$62 - $99             | 20 - 40 mins | Speed & Ease          |
| Shared Shuttle         | ~$25 - $40             | 45 - 75 mins | Door-to-Door Value    |

Note: Travel times can be heavily affected by traffic, especially during morning (7:00 AM - 9:30 AM) and evening (4:00 PM - 6:30 PM) peak hours.

> **Visitor Tip:** Always ask for a **fixed fare** or **flat rate** to the city *before* you get in. Metered fares can be much more expensive (up to $90-$100+ in bad traffic).

## Meals

Meals during the day for Harmony 2026 will be provided in coordination with the other digital twins meetings. 
For evening meals there is a great selection of a wide variety of restaurants a short walk or short taxi/Uber from the conference location.

## Power outlet

Type I plugs are used in New Zealand, featuring three flat pins arranged in a triangular pattern. They operate on a voltage of 230V and are designed to ensure safety with an earth pin for grounding.
