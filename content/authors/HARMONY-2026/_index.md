<br/>

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2026 will be held at the **University of Auckland**.

Local organizers are <a href="mailto:d.nickerson@auckland.ac.nz">David Nickerson</a> and colleagues at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute.

## a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi/news-and-events/digital-twin-meetings-2026.html">Auckland Human Digital Twin Meetings 2026</a>

From 2–12 Feb 2026, the Auckland Bioengineering Institute hosts three workshops in Auckland advancing digital twin modelling, interoperability standards, and clinical translation.

Find conference accommodation rates, venue and transport information for getting around Auckland, details on the other workshops happening during the same period, information about Waitangi Day — New Zealand’s national holiday, which falls during the meetings; as well as an optional Waiheke Island excursion and plenty of things to do and places to dine around the city.

## Workshop Location

HARMONY 2026 will be held at the University of Auckland. It will be co-located with the 2026 <a href="https://cardiacphysiome.org">Cardiac Physiome Workshop</a>.

## Schedule (Draft)

<img src="/images/harmony2026/draft_schedule.png" alt="draft schedule" class="img-responsive">

## Arrival and Transportation

Getting from Auckland Airport (AKL) to the central city (also known as the 'CBD') is straightforward. Your main options depend on your budget, time, and preference for convenience.

Here’s a breakdown of the best ways to travel.

Note: Travel times can be heavily affected by traffic, especially during morning (7:00 AM - 9:30 AM) and evening (4:00 PM - 6:30 PM) peak hours.


### 1. Express Bus (SkyDrive)

This is a dedicated express bus service that runs directly between the airport and the SkyCity Terminal in the central city.

* **Best for:** Solo travellers, couples, and those who want a direct, simple bus route without transfers.
* **Approx. Cost:** ~$17 - $18 NZD per adult, one-way.
* **Approx. Time:** 35 - 50 minutes (traffic dependent).
* **Frequency:** Runs every 30 minutes during its operating hours (typically 5:00 AM to 10:30 PM).
* **Where to find it:** Follow the "Buses & Shuttles" signs at the international or domestic terminal. Look for the designated SkyDrive stop.

### 2. Public Transport (Bus & Train)

This is the most budget-friendly option. It involves two steps: taking the **AirportLink bus** (it's bright orange!) to **Puhinui Train Station**, and then catching a train to **Britomart Station** (which is in the downtown CBD).

* **Best for:** Budget-conscious travellers, backpackers, and those with light luggage.
* **Approx. Cost:** ~$6.50 NZD total one-way. You can pay with a contactless credit/debit card (Visa, Mastercard) or by purchasing an AT HOP card (a reusable prepay card).
* **Approx. Time:** 50 - 60 minutes total (10-12 min bus + transfer + 25 min train).
* **Frequency:** The AirportLink bus runs very frequently (every 10-12 minutes) from 4:30 AM to 12:40 AM, 7 days a week.
* **Where to find it:** Follow the "Public Transport" or "AT" signs to the bus stop. You can buy an AT HOP card from the "Take Home" convenience store in the international arrivals hall.

### 3. Ride-Sharing (Uber, Ola, etc.)

Services like Uber are a popular, convenient, and often cheaper-than-a-taxi option.

* **Best for:** Convenience, travelling directly to your accommodation, and groups of 2-3.
* **Approx. Cost:** ~$40 - $65 NZD (This can vary significantly based on demand, traffic, and the specific service you choose).
* **Approx. Time:** 25 - 45 minutes.
* **Where to find it:** Follow the signs for the "Ride-Share" pickup zone, which is a short walk from the arrivals terminal. You book this via the app on your phone.

### 4. Taxi (Fixed Fare)

Taxis are available 24/7 directly outside the terminals.

> **Visitor Tip:** Always ask for a **fixed fare** or **flat rate** to the city *before* you get in. Metered fares can be much more expensive (up to $90-$100+ in bad traffic).

* **Best for:** Maximum convenience, travelling with heavy luggage, or groups.
* **Approx. Cost:** ~$62 - $99 NZD for a fixed fare from a licensed airport taxi.
* **Approx. Time:** 20 - 40 minutes (this is often the fastest way outside of peak traffic).
* **Where to find it:** Follow the "Taxis" signs to the official taxi rank just outside the arrivals doors.

### 5. Shared Shuttle (e.g., Super Shuttle)

These are vans that take multiple groups of passengers heading in the same direction. It's a door-to-door service that can be cost-effective, especially for groups.

* **Best for:** Solo travellers who want door-to-door service for less than a taxi, or for small groups.
* **Approx. Cost:** Varies. The price per person often gets cheaper as you add more people to your group.
* **Approx. Time:** 45 - 75 minutes (it can take longer as they may drop off other passengers before you).
* **Where to find it:** You can pre-book online or find the "Shared Shuttle" rank at the terminal.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Method                 | Approx. Cost (1 Adult) | Approx. Time | Best For              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Public Transport       | ~$6.50                 | 50 - 60 mins | Budget                |
| Express Bus (SkyDrive) | ~$18                   | 35 - 50 mins | Simplicity & Value    |
| Ride-Share (Uber)      | ~$40 - $65             | 25 - 45 mins | On-Demand Convenience |
| Taxi (Fixed Fare)      | ~$62 - $99             | 20 - 40 mins | Speed & Ease          |
| Shared Shuttle         | ~$25 - $40             | 45 - 75 mins | Door-to-Door Value    |

## Accommodation

Accommodation has been combined with the Human Digital Twin meetings and information on accommodation can be found there

[Accommodation information](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi/news-and-events/digital-twin-meetings-2026/conference-accommodation.html)

## Meals

Meals during the day for Harmony 2026 will be provided in coordination with the other digital twins meetings. 
For evening meals there is a selection of restaurants a short walk or taxi/Uber from the conference location.

## Power outlet

Type I plugs are used in Australia and New Zealand, featuring three flat pins arranged in a triangular pattern. They operate on a voltage of 230V and are designed to ensure safety with an earth pin for grounding.
