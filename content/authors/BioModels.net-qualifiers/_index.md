- <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://co.mbine.org/specifications/qualifiers"> BioModels.net qualifiers </a> are standardized relationships (predicates) that specify the relation between an object represented in a description language and the external resource used to annotate it. The relationship is rarely one-to-one, and the information content of an annotation is greatly increased if one knows what it represents, rather than only know it is "related to" the model component.
