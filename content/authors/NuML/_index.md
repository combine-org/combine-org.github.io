- The [Numerical Markup Language (NuML)](http://code.google.com/p/numl/) (pronounce "neumeul" and not "new em el", that sounds like NewML) is a simple XML format to exchange multidimensional arrays of numbers to be used with model and simulation descriptions. NuML was initially developed as part of the [Systems Biology Results Markup Language (SBRML)](https://sbrml.sourceforge.net/SBRML/Welcome.html).
