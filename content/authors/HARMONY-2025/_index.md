<br/>

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2025 was held at **KU Leuven**, Leuven, Belgium, 15-18 April 2025.

The local organizers were <a href="mailto:liesbet.geris@kuleuven.be">Liesbet Geris</a>, <a href="mailto:lcladeira@uliege.be">Luiz Ladeira</a>, and <a href="mailto:b.staumont@uliege.be">Bernard Staumont</a>. 

<h3>Sister Meetings</h3>

**9th Disease Maps Community Meeting - DMCM2025**

Simultaneously from 15th to 17th April 2025 at the same venue.

The 2025 edition of the Disease Maps Community Meeting took take place in Leuven, Belgium. This annual gathering brings together the researchers, clinicians, and domain experts involved in mapping and modelling disease mechanisms. The meeting provides a forum for exchanging best practices, sharing information, and developing tools to advance the use of systems medicine in translational medicine projects and decision making support. Building on the success of previous editions in locations like Belval, Maastricht, Sevilla, and Paris, the 2025 meeting in Leuven is attracted a diverse group of participants dedicated to furthering the understanding and application of disease maps in research and healthcare.

The DMCM2025 was held simultaneously with HARMONY 2025, in the same venue. This enhanced interaction between the COMBINE and the Disease Maps communities, fostering collaboration opportunities and networking. Coffee breaks and meals were shared between both meetings.

More information can be found here: [DMCM2025](https://disease-maps.io/DMCM2025/). 

**byteMAL'25**

Monday 14th April 2025

ByteMAL is a conference created by and for early-career researchers in the fields of bioinformatics and systems biomedicine and aims to provide a networking platform for knowledge and expertise exchange across borders. Aiming to vitalize communication amongst researchers from The Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, ByteMAL has been hosted alternately by the Universities of Maastricht, Aachen, and Liege and for the first time it comes to Leuven! More information will be announced soon.

<h2>Schedule</h2> 

The schedule is available below. People who have attended HARMONY in the past will know that this is inclined to change as participants make their own arrangements for conversations/discussions. A link to the editable version will be sent to the mailing list.

<h2><a href="https://forms.gle/TJzaMwLp7Q67RCwD6" target="_blank">Call for Breakout Sessions and Tutorials</a></h2>

All attendees can suggest breakout sessions for hacking and/or detailed discussions of certain aspects of one or several of the COMBINE standard(s), metadata and semantic annotations (format-specific or overarching), application and implementations of the COMBINE standards, or any other topic relevant for the COMBINE community. The topics for those breakout sessions, and the time slots which would suit their communities can be submitted via the link above. Note, breakout session organizers will be responsible for creating and hosting their own online sessions, if required.

<h2><a href="https://forms.gle/o8P3zvfdaEoLKUao8" target="_blank">Call for Lightning Talks and Posters</a></h2>

Requests for a lightning talk (5 min max.) and/or poster can be submitted via the link above. Please use several forms if you want to submit abstracts on different topics. The submission deadline is outlined above. Talks will take place during the community session and posters will be displayed throughout the meeting.
