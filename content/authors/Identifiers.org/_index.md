- The [identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org/) web site uses MIRIAM Unique Resource Identifiers to allow one to uniquely and unambiguously identify an entity in a stable and perennial manner.  Identifiers.org URIs can be dereferenced in a flexible and robust way, and are used by SBML, SED-ML, CellML and BioPAX controlled annotation schemes.
