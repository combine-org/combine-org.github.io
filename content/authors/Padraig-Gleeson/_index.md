Padraig Gleeson is a Principal Research Fellow at University College London. His work focuses on development of tools and standards to facilitate the generation, analysis and sharing of models of biologically detailed neuronal networks. He has developed <a class="external text" href="http://www.neuroConstruct.org">neuroConstruct</a>, a graphical application for constructing and analysing such models in 3D. He is the main technical contributor to the <a class="external text" href="http://www.neuroml.org">NeuroML</a> language for simulator independent model descriptions in neuroscience. He leads the development of the <a class="external text" href="http://www.opensourcebrain.org">Open Source Brain</a> repository which aims to facilitate the sharing and collaborative development of neuronal models in an open source environment. He is also a Senior Contributor to the <a class="external text" href="http://www.openworm.org">OpenWorm project</a> which is seeking to create a highly detailed <i>in-silico</i> model of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>.
