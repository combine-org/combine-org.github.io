The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. **COMBINE 2023** will be a workshop-style event hosted at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) at the [University of Connecticut School of Medicine](https://medicine.uconn.edu/), Farmington, CT, USA. The meeting will be held in October 2023, closely aligned with the dates of the [**International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB)**](https://icsb2023.bioscience-ct.net/) October 8-12 in Hartford, CT. The meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials. There are no dedicated poster sessions, but paricipants are encouraged to bring posters - poster boards will be provided next to meeting places. Some time each day will be left for community discussion and wrap-ups of breakouts and advertisements for following breakouts. It will be primarily an in-person meeting, with individual breakout sessions responsible for enabling remote participation as needed.

Local organizers are Michael Blinov (blinov@uchc.edu) and Ion Moraru (moraru@uchc.edu).

<h3>Schedule</h3>

A draft schedule will be available soon. Note that many events are scheduled somewhat spontaneously at these events; keep an eye out here or on the COMBINE slack for last-minute changes and additions.

<h3>Workshop Location</h3>

COMBINE 2023 takes place at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling (CCAM)](https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) in Farmington, CT. **COMBINE 2023** will take place in the Cell and Genome Sciences building, at [400 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06119](https://goo.gl/maps/Ms25yakj7NU7dFsv5). If the doors are locked, please knock, email blinov@uchc.edu or moraru@uchc.edu, or ping us on the [COMBINE slack channel](https://combine-workspace.slack.com).

<h3>Arrival and Transportation</h3>

The closest airport is the [Bradley International Airport (BDL)](https://bradleyairport.com/). The recommended transportation is to take Uber/Lyft to 400 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT. It takes about 25 minutes and costs about $40. You may rent a car at BDL - all parking at the workshop location and hotel are free. A less expensive but long travel from BDL is to take Bradley Flyer Bus (#30) from BDL to Central Row North Side at Old State House Station, and then take a [bus 66T](https://goo.gl/maps/9BpUPEqBUb5Zgrnm7) from Main St & Asylum St to 400 Farmington Ave. It takes 1 to 3 hours depending on schedules. 

<h3>Accomodations and meals</h3>

The closest hotel to the CCAM is the [Homewood Suites by Hilton Hartford-Farmington](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/hfdfmhw-homewood-suites-hartford-farmington/) at [2 Farm Glen Boulevard, Farmington, Connecticut, 06032](https://goo.gl/maps/jMK2dqEYqKSDf7vC7); it's [7 minutes walk](https://goo.gl/maps/D5j5SQnSLiRQFaKx9) between there and the venue. A University rate of $154/night will be provided upon request. There are more hotels in the area, but any other hotel will require a car.

The hotel serves hot breakfast. There is a [Butchers and Bakers restaurant](https://butchersandbakers.com/) 15 minutes walk, but no food stores within walking distance. We will serve food at the venue, depending on the sponsors it may be free or for a nominal fee.
