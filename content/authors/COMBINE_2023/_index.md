information:
- name: Purpose
  description: The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. **COMBINE 2023** will be a workshop-style event hosted at the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling at the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA. The meeting will be held in October 2023, closely aligned with the dates of the **ICSB** meeting. The meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials. There are no dedicated poster sessions, but paricipants are encouraged to bring posters - poster boards will be provided next to meeting places. Some time each day will be left for community discussion and wrap-ups of breakouts and advertisements for following breakouts. It will be primarily an in-person meeting, with individual breakout sessions responsible for enabling remote participation as needed.

The topics for those breakout sessions, and the time slots which would suit their communities can be submitted via the link above.
