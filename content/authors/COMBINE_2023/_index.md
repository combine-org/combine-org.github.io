- name: Call for Breakout Sessions and Tutorials
  description: All attendees can suggest breakout sessions for hacking and/or detailed discussions of certain aspects of one or several of the COMBINE standard(s), metadata and semantic annotations (format-specific or overarching), application and implementations of the COMBINE standards, or any other topic relevant for the COMBINE community. The topics for those breakout sessions, and the time slots which would suit their communities can be submitted via the link above. Note, breakout session organisers will be responsible for creating and hosting their own online sessions, if required.

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. **COMBINE 2023** will be a workshop-style event hosted at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) at the [University of Connecticut School of Medicine](https://medicine.uconn.edu/), Farmington, CT, USA. The meeting will be held in October 2023, closely aligned with the dates of the [**International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB)**](https://icsb2023.bioscience-ct.net/) October 8-12 in Hartford, CT. Tutorials at the last day (Sunday October 8th) will take place at the ICSB 2023 venue - in the convention center. The meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials. There are no dedicated poster sessions, but paricipants are encouraged to bring posters - poster boards will be provided next to meeting places. Some time each day will be left for community discussion and wrap-ups of breakouts and advertisements for following breakouts. It will be primarily an in-person meeting, with individual breakout sessions responsible for enabling remote participation as needed.

Local organizers are Michael Blinov (blinov@uchc.edu) and Ion Moraru (moraru@uchc.edu).

<h3>A tentative schedule</h3>

<img src="/images/combine2023/schedule.png" width="100%" alt="schedule.png">Note that many events are scheduled somewhat spontaneously at these events; keep an eye out here or on the COMBINE slack for last-minute changes and additions.

<h3>Workshop Location</h3>

COMBINE 2023 takes place at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling (CCAM)](https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) in Farmington, CT. **COMBINE 2023** will take place in the Cell and Genome Sciences building, at [400 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06119](https://goo.gl/maps/Ms25yakj7NU7dFsv5). If the doors are locked, please knock, email blinov@uchc.edu or moraru@uchc.edu, or ping us on the [COMBINE slack channel](https://combine-workspace.slack.com).

<h3>Arrival and Transportation</h3>

The closest airport is the [Bradley International Airport (BDL)](https://bradleyairport.com/). The recommended transportation is to take Uber/Lyft to 400 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT. It takes about 25 minutes and costs about $40. You may rent a car at BDL - all parking at the workshop location and hotel are free. A less expensive but long travel from BDL is to take Bradley Flyer Bus (#30) from BDL to Central Row North Side at Old State House Station, and then take a [bus 66T](https://goo.gl/maps/9BpUPEqBUb5Zgrnm7) from Main St & Asylum St to 400 Farmington Ave. It takes 1 to 3 hours depending on schedules. 

<h3>Accomodations and meals</h3>

The closest hotel to the CCAM is the [Homewood Suites by Hilton Hartford-Farmington](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/hfdfmhw-homewood-suites-hartford-farmington/) at [2 Farm Glen Boulevard, Farmington, Connecticut, 06032](https://goo.gl/maps/jMK2dqEYqKSDf7vC7); it's [7 minutes walk](https://goo.gl/maps/D5j5SQnSLiRQFaKx9) between there and the venue. A University rate of $154/night will be provided upon request. There are more hotels in the area, but any other hotel will require a car.

The hotel serves hot breakfast. There is a [Butchers and Bakers restaurant](https://butchersandbakers.com/) 15 minutes walk, but no food stores within walking distance. We will serve food at the venue, depending on the sponsors it may be free or for a nominal fee.

| Amir Mahari | University of Arkansas | Oct 5 Oct 6 Oct 7 Oct 8 | SBML;SBGN;Multicellular modeling | I focus on the modeling and simulation of intercellular signaling pathways within melanoma cancer cells. This study holds significance due to the intricate nature of signaling cascades that regulate various cellular processes in melanoma progression. To facilitate this investigation, I employ PySB (Python Systems Biology), a powerful computational framework designed for creating, simulating, and analyzing mathematical models of biochemical systems. PySB's modular and user-friendly nature enables me to construct complex models of intercellular signaling, incorporating factors such as ligand-receptor interactions, protein phosphorylation, and gene expression. Through PySB's simulation capabilities, I can dynamically analyze the behavior of these pathways under different conditions, gaining insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive melanoma growth and metastasis. Ultimately, this research using PySB contributes to an enhanced understanding of melanoma biology, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions and personalized treatment strategies in combating this aggressive form of cancer. |
