The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. COMBINE 2023 will be a workshop-style event hosted at the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA. The meeting will be held in October 2023, closely aligned with the dates of the ICSB meeting. The meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials.
