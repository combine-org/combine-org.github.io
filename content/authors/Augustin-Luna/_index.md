bio: Augustin Luna (PhD in Bioinformatics) is an Investigator at the Computational Biology Branch, National Library of Medicine (NLM) & Developmental Therapeutics Branch, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Luna lab conducts research to improve clinical outcomes, concentrated on areas of 1) network biology; specifically, mechanisms of external perturbation response using machine learning methods, and 2) standardizing biological data representations for integration. His group develops software tools for cancer drug discovery using network-guided approaches like SketchLay, TargetScore, CausalPath, textToKnowledgeGraph, CellMiner Cross-Database (CellMinerCDB), TumorComparer, NetBoxR, CellBox, drGT, DrugAgent, etc. He is also involved in the development of BioPAX and SBGN.
