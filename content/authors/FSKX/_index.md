- The [FAIR Scientific Knowledge eXchange (FSKX)](https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/fskx-food-safety-knowledge-exchange-format/) Format is an open, standardized file format designed to facilitate the efficient sharing of scientific models and datasets in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) manner. Originally developed as the Food Safety Knowledge Exchange (FSKX) Format within the Risk Assessment Knowledge Integration Platform (RAKIP) Initiative, FSKX has evolved into a general-purpose format for exchanging models across multiple scientific domains, including Life Sciences, Food Safety, One Health, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
