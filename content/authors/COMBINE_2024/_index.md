The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. **COMBINE 2024** will be a workshop-style event hosted at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) in Stuttgart, Germany with support of the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en) through the International scientific events program, the [Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science (SimTech)](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) and the [Stuttgart Research Center Systems Biology (SRCSB)](https://www.srcsb.uni-stuttgart.de/). The meeting will be held in September 2024, closely aligned with the dates of the [**Virtual Physiological Human (VPH)2024 Conference**](https://www.vph-institute.org/events/vph2024-conference.html) September 04-06 Stuttgart, Germany.

The official programm takes place from Sunday 01st to Tuesday 3rd September. On Wednesday 4th and Thursday 5th September, there will be rooms provided for personal meetings only. The meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials. There will be also a dedicated poster session, participants are encouraged to bring posters - poster boards will be provided next to meeting places. Some time each day will be left for community discussion and wrap-ups of breakouts and advertisements for following breakouts. It will be primarily an in-person meeting, with individual breakout sessions responsible for enabling remote participation as needed.

Local organizers are Nicole Radde (nicole.radde@simtech.uni-stuttgart.de) and Sebastian Höpfl (sebastian.hoepfl@isa.uni-stuttgart.de).

<h3>A tentative schedule</h3>

<img src="/images/combine2024/schedule.png" width="100%" alt="schedule.png">Note that many events are scheduled somewhat spontaneously at these events; keep an eye out here or on the COMBINE slack for last-minute changes and additions.

<h3>Workshop Location</h3>

COMBINE 2024 takes place at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) in Stuttgart, Germany. **COMBINE 2024** will take place in the former Campus Guest building, at [Universitätsstrasse 34, 70569 Stuttgart](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9xMcuQidufZzgVUb9). If you do not find the venue, email sebastian.hoepfl@isa.uni-stuttgart.de or nicole.radde@simtech.uni-stuttgart.de, or ping us on the [COMBINE slack channel](https://combine-workspace.slack.com).

<h3>Arrival and Transportation</h3>

The closest airport is the [Stuttgart Airport (STR)](https://www.stuttgart-airport.com/?cl=en). However, overseas the International Airport of Frankfurt [Frankfurt Airport (FRA)](https://www.frankfurt-airport.com/en.html) is probably the better choice. There are ICEs and ICs going from the Frankfurt Airport to Stuttgart every one to two hours. You can book the train tickets via the [Deutsche Bahn](https://int.bahn.de/en) website. The Campus in Stuttgart, where we will host the Combine2024 is a 10 minute drive from the city center of Stuttgart. You can take the S-Bahn lines 1, 2 and 3 to the station "University". Alternatively, if you come by car, set your destination at "Universitätsstrasse 34. 70569 Stuttgart (Campus Vaihingen)".

<h3>Accomodation</h3>

There are no hotels at the workshop venue. However, you can find accommodations along the S-Bahn route, such as near the stations "Hauptbahnhof", "Stadtmitte", "Feuersee" or „Schwabstraße" (e.g. [Studierendenhotel Stuttgart](https://www.studierendenhotel-stuttgart.de/en), [Römerhof Vaihingen](https://roemerhof-kulinarium.de/en/roemerhof/)). From these stations you will need approximately 15-20 minutes to the campus.
