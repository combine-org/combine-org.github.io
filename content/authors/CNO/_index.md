- The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/INCF/Computational-Neurosciences-Ontology--C.N.O.-">Computational Neurosciences Ontology</a> aims to be a domain specific ontology, describing Computational Neurosciences models. CNO was created to add semantic information to NineML, a simulator independent language developed by the [INCF Multi-Scale modeling Program](https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/nineml-spec/downloads/pdf/latest/).  NineML aims to provide an unambiguous description of neuronal network models for efficient model sharing and reusability.
