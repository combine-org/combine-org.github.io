- More information about standards used to share data in life sciences can be found at [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/). The FAIRsharing team manually curates data and metadata standards, databases and data policies across all scientific research areas. FAIRsharing provides links among these standards and databases as well as to journal and funder data policies that recommend or endorse their use. For example, FAIRsharing contains a collection of the COMBINE standards as well as many [Systems Biology resources](https://fairsharing.org/search/?q=systems%20biology&selected_facets=expanded_onto_disciplines_exact%3ASystems%20Biology).
