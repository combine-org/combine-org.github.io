The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. COMBINE 2022 will be a workshop-style event with oral presentations, breakout sessions and tutorials. The three meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials.

COMBINE 2022 will be an **in-person meeting** organised as a satellite to the [ICSB 2022 meeting](https://www.icsb2022.berlin/) in Berlin.

<h1>Overview</h1>

<h3>COMBINE Community meet-up</h3>

**Two days of breakout sessions and tutorials related to COMBINE standards**

**Thus 6th & Fri 7th Oct**, 9am-6pm at [Humboldt University of Berlin, Philippstraße 13, Haus 20](https://goo.gl/maps/fkXSerwGRWSFUPSC9)

All attendees can suggest **breakout sessions** for detailed discussions of certain aspects of one or several of the COMBINE standard(s),
discussions on metadata and semantic annotations (format-specific or overarching), discussions on the application and implementations
of the COMBINE standards, or any other topic relevant for the COMBINE community.

We also solicit applications to host **tutorials** on tools, standards or resources (or any other topic) which would be relevant for the
COMBINE community (see Topics of Interest below). The link to submit suggestions for breakout sessions or tutorials is
 [here](https://forms.gle/4VHZTxR5FcY2GLhR8), and the deadline is on the left.

<h3>COMBINE Forum</h3>

**Single track session with invited and submitted talks**

**Sat 8th Oct**, 8am-1pm at [Humboldt University of Berlin, Philippstraße 13, Haus 20](https://goo.gl/maps/fkXSerwGRWSFUPSC9)

To submit an abstract for the **COMBINE Forum** on Saturday October 8, please use the official ICSB abstract submission portal on EasyChair:
- Submit your abstract at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsb2022
- Select "COMBINE: Satellite Event" as your submission topic

| 11am |  <b><i>Invited Talk</i></b> <br/> **Documentation of simulation studies --- beyond reproducibility** <br/>  **Adelinde Uhrmacher, Institute for Visual and Analytic Computing, University Rostock** <br/> By storing information about a simulation study within a provenance graph the stored information becomes queryable and the dependencies between different modeling and experimenting activities and the used or generated entities become visually accessible. Combined with explicit unambiguous model and simulation experiment specifications such a documentation enhances the reproducibility of the simulation study and the credibility of its products. However, as every documentation of a simulation study, it requires additional effort by the modeler. Therefore, to make the most out of the documentation, how can it be used beyond being a source of information for the modeler about the current or a previous simulation study? In this talk we will discuss the potential, challenges, and experiences in using information stored in a provenance graph to generate and execute simulation experiments during simulation studies automatically. |
