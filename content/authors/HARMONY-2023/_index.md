# - name: Call for Breakout Sessions
#  description: All attendees can suggest breakout sessions for hacking and/or detailed discussions of certain aspects of one or several of the COMBINE standard(s), metadata and semantic annotations (format-specific or overarching), application and implementations of the COMBINE standards, or any other topic relevant for the COMBINE community. The topics for those breakout sessions, and the time slots which would suit their communities can be submitted via the link above. Note, breakout session organisers will be responsible for creating and hosting their own online sessions.

The Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

HARMONY 2023 will be hosted by Herbert Sauro and the Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. It is going to be organized primarily as an in-person meeting, with individual breakout sessions responsible for enabling remote participation as needed.

Most of each day will be scheduled by the communities as breakouts. In addition, we will have some time each day for community discussion and wrap-ups of breakouts and advertisements for following breakouts.

<h1>Workshop Location Details</h1>

HARMONY 2023 takes place at the University of Washington (UW, and commonly called "U-Dub") in Seattle, Washington. HARMONY 2023 will take place in the William H. Foege Bioengineering building, more details will be forthcoming.
