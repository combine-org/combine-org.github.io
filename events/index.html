The meeting will be held in October 2023, closely aligned with the dates of the <a href=https://icsb2023.bioscience-ct.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB)</strong></a> October 8-12 in Hartford, CT. Tutorials at the last day (Sunday October 8th) will take place at the ICSB 2023 venue - in the convention center. The meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, presentations of tools using these standards, breakout sessions for detailed discussions as well as tutorials. There are no dedicated poster sessions, but paricipants are encouraged to bring posters - poster boards will be provided next to meeting places. Some time each day will be left for community discussion and wrap-ups of breakouts and advertisements for following breakouts. It will be primarily an in-person meeting, with individual breakout sessions responsible for enabling remote participation as needed.</p><p>Local organizers are Michael Blinov (<a href=mailto:blinov@uchc.edu>blinov@uchc.edu</a>) and Ion Moraru (<a href=mailto:moraru@uchc.edu>moraru@uchc.edu</a>).</p><h3>A tentative schedule</h3><p><img src=/images/combine2023/schedule1.png width=100% alt=schedule1.png>Note that many events are scheduled somewhat spontaneously at these events; keep an eye out here or on the COMBINE slack for last-minute changes and additions.</p><h3>Workshop Location</h3><p>COMBINE 2023 takes place at the <a href=https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling (CCAM)</a> in Farmington, CT. <strong>COMBINE 2023</strong> will take place in the Cell and Genome Sciences building, at <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/Ms25yakj7NU7dFsv5 target=_blank rel=noopener>400 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06119</a>. If the doors are locked, please knock, email <a href=mailto:blinov@uchc.edu>blinov@uchc.edu</a> or <a href=mailto:moraru@uchc.edu>moraru@uchc.edu</a>, or ping us on the <a href=https://combine-workspace.slack.com target=_blank rel=noopener>COMBINE slack channel</a>.</p><img src=/images/combine2023/ccam3.png width=100% alt=ccam3.png><h3>Arrival and Transportation</h3><p>The closest airport is the <a href=https://bradleyairport.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Bradley International Airport (BDL)</a>. The recommended transportation is to take Uber/Lyft to 400 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT. It takes about 25 minutes and costs about $40. You may rent a car at BDL - all parking at the workshop location and hotel are free. A less expensive but long travel from BDL is to take Bradley Flyer Bus (#30) from BDL to Central Row North Side at Old State House Station, and then take a <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/9BpUPEqBUb5Zgrnm7 target=_blank rel=noopener>bus 66T</a> from Main St & Asylum St to 400 Farmington Ave. It takes 1 to 3 hours depending on schedules.</p><h3>Accomodations and meals</h3><p>The closest hotel to the CCAM is the <a href=https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/hfdfmhw-homewood-suites-hartford-farmington/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Homewood Suites by Hilton Hartford-Farmington</a> at <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/jMK2dqEYqKSDf7vC7 target=_blank rel=noopener>2 Farm Glen Boulevard, Farmington, Connecticut, 06032</a>; it&rsquo;s <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/D5j5SQnSLiRQFaKx9 target=_blank rel=noopener>7 minutes walk</a> between there and the venue. A University rate of $154/night will be provided upon request. There are more hotels in the area, but any other hotel will require a car.</p><p>The hotel serves hot breakfast. There is a <a href=https://butchersandbakers.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Butchers and Bakers restaurant</a> 15 minutes walk, but no food stores within walking distance. We will serve food at the venue, depending on the sponsors it may be free or for a nominal fee.</p><h3 id=a-nameattendeesaattendees><a name=attendees></a>Attendees</h3><p>76 registered participants as of October 2</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name<hr>Affiliation</th><th>Attendance<br>in person</th><th>Interested<hr>Projects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Alan Garny</b><br>University of Auckland</td><td>remotely</td><td>SED-ML, OMEX, COMBINE;CellML;Ontologies (SBO, KiSAO)<hr>libOpenCOR (<a href=https://opencor.ws/libopencor/>https://opencor.ws/libopencor/</a>) and OpenCOR (<a href=https://opencor.ws/>https://opencor.ws/</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Alex Patrie</b><br>UConn Health</td><td>Oct 5 Oct 6 Oct 7 Oct 8</td><td>SBML;SED-ML, OMEX, COMBINE;CellML;Multicellular modeling<hr>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Amin Boroomand</b><br>Woods Hole institute</td><td>Oct 5 Oct 6 Oct 7 Oct 8</td><td>SBML;Multicellular modeling<hr>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Amir Mahari</b><br>University of Arkansas</td><td>Oct 5 Oct 6 Oct 7 Oct 8</td><td>SBML;SBGN;Multicellular modeling<hr>I focus on the modeling and simulation of intercellular signaling pathways within melanoma cancer cells. This study holds significance due to the intricate nature of signaling cascades that regulate various cellular processes in melanoma progression. To facilitate this investigation, I employ PySB (Python Systems Biology), a powerful computational framework designed for creating, simulating, and analyzing mathematical models of biochemical systems. PySB&rsquo;s modular and user-friendly nature enables me to construct complex models of intercellular signaling, incorporating factors such as ligand-receptor interactions, protein phosphorylation, and gene expression. Through PySB&rsquo;s simulation capabilities, I can dynamically analyze the behavior of these pathways under different conditions, gaining insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive melanoma growth and metastasis. Ultimately, this research using PySB contributes to an enhanced understanding of melanoma biology, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions and personalized treatment strategies in combating this aggressive form of cancer.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Aniruddha Chattaraj</b><br>Harvard University</td><td>Oct 5 Oct 6 Oct 7 Oct 8</td><td>SED-ML, OMEX, COMBINE;Multicellular modeling<hr>Modeling of multivalent protein clustering, statistical analysis of cluster properties and visualization.

Familiarity with SED-ML (https://sed-ml.org/) is advantageous but not essential.<br><p>Overview: The evolution of computational biology demands a more adaptable and integrative exchange format. While SED-ML has been instrumental, the emerging needs of the community call for a successor: SED2. This session will focus on the core priorities for SED2: flexibility, the ability to compose different simulation methods with custom annotations, and fostering a computational framework that works with the diverse range of simulation tools within the biological modeling community.<br></p><p>Session Goals:</p><ul><li>SED-ML Reflection: A recap of SED-ML&rsquo;s journey, emphasizing its strengths and areas of improvement.</li><li>Core Priorities for SED2: Deep dive into the need for flexibility and compositionality, and the significance of custom annotations.</li><li>Building a Collaborative Framework: Engage in discussions to establish a common ground where members of the Biosimulations community can converge on SED2&rsquo;s direction.</li><li>Exchange Format and API Exploration: Deliberate on the potential of adopting formats like JSON for SED2 and brainstorm on the design of an intuitive API for seamless interactions with the new format.</li></ul><hr><b>Standardizing Multicellular Simulation - Bridging Methods and Models</b> Eran Agmon (UConn Health), T.J. Sego (U of Florida); James Glazier (Indiana University)<br>Intended Audience: Researchers, bioinformaticians, software developers, and modelers who are involved in or interested in multicellular simulations across various methodologies. Prior experience with basic concepts in computational biology or multicellular modeling is beneficial but not mandatory.<br><p>Overview: Multicellular simulations have become indispensable in understanding complex biological phenomena, from tissue development to disease progression. But the diversity in simulation methods ‚ from agent-based models, cellular Potts models, cellular automata, lattice-free models, stochastic particle simulations, etc‚ poses challenges in reproducibility, modularity, reusability, and integration within multi-scale simulation. This session aims to bridge these gaps by focusing on the development of standards and schemas, with special emphasis on multiscale, embedded, and coupled simulation methods. Through a combination of presentations, case studies, and discussions, attendees will gain an understanding of the multicellular simulation landscape, the need for standardization, and the importance of sharing and reusing models.<br></p><p>Session Goals:</p><ul><li>Landscape of Multicellular Simulations: An overview of the various methods employed in multicellular simulations, highlighting their unique features and common challenges.</li><li>The Need for Standards: Discussion on the current gaps and inconsistencies in multicellular simulation methodologies and the implications for research reproducibility and collaboration.</li><li>Designing Schemas for Multicellularity: Collaborative brainstorming on creating robust and flexible schemas that can cater to the diverse range of multicellular simulation methods.</li><li>Integration and Interoperability: Delve into strategies for ensuring that the developed standards promote seamless integration and interoperability among different simulation tools and platforms.</li></ul><hr><b>FROG curation for genome-scale metabolic models</b> Karthik Raman, Rahuman Sheriff and other FROG contributors (Indian Institute of Technology, Madras)<br>Community standards for consistent reconstruction, FAIR sharing and curation of constraint-based models such as genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are crucial to ensure their reproducibility and reliability. We initiated a community effort for a standardised assessment of reproducibility and curation of constraint-based models. Following the discussions at dedicated breakout sessions at HARMONY and COMBINE meetings over the past two
years, we have developed the FROG analysis, an ensemble of analysis of constraint-based
models to test the reproducibility of numerical simulation based on a set of standardized
analyses. FROG analysis encompasses Flux variability analysis (FVA), Reaction deletion
analysis, Objective function calculation, and Gene deletion analysis. We have also
developed a collection of tools that generate FROG reports in a standardized schema to
enable a reliable assessment of model reproducibility based on popular constraint-based
software and a web-service. FROG analysis is currently used in BioModels‚Äô workflow to
curate and build a collection of FAIR and reproducible genome-scale metabolic models.<hr><b>Recent Progress and Future Work Towards Reproducible Stochastic Biological Simulation</b> T.J. Sego (University of Florida); Rahuman S. Malik Sheriff (European Molecular Biology Laboratory)<br>Stochastic simulations are commonly used to quantitatively or semi-quantitatively describe the dynamics of biological systems. At various scales and in multiple applications, stochastic simulation better reflects observed biological processes and robustness. Various methods are widely used to incorporate stochasticity into biological simulation, such as the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm for systems biology modeling, stochastic Boolean networks for network modeling, and the Cellular Potts model methodology for multicellular modeling. Proving reproducibility of simulation results is critical to establishing the credibility of a model. To this end, BioModels, the largest repository of curated mathematical models, tests and reports the reproducibility of simulation results for all submitted models when possible. A recent study showed that about 50% of the deterministic ordinary differential equation models on BioModels could not be reproduced when applying criteria for reproducibility to the information provided in their associated publication, reflecting a current crisis of reproducibility. Furthermore, there are no well-accepted metrics or standards for reproducing stochastic simulation results, thus perpetuating the crisis of reproducibility for a broad class of biological models. This breakout session aims to establish an accepted framework for testing the reproducibility of stochastic simulations in biological modeling. The session will provide an overview of recent progress towards defining quantitative measures to determine whether stochastic simulation results can be reproduced, and when results have been reproduced. Attendees will discuss current issues to address towards consensus and broad adoption in relevant modeling communities, as well as future work towards reproducibility of stochastic simulation results using multiscale and complex models.<hr><b>PEtab: current state and future directions</b> Dilan Pathirana, Frank Bergmann (University of Bonn)<br>PEtab is a standardized file format for specifying parameter estimation problems [1]. The interoperable format is currently supported by 11 different tools [2], enabling users to benefit from standardized parameter estimation across frameworks based in Python, Julia, R, MATLAB, C++, or GUIs.<p>Although PEtab was initially developed for parameter estimation, recent efforts have extended the format to improve standardization of various adjacent tasks, including: model selection, multi-scale modeling, PKPD and NLME modeling, optimal control, and visualization.</p><p>In this breakout session, based on audience interests, we will present introductions to PEtab and its extensions, then discuss current efforts to improve PEtab. People unfamiliar with PEtab are welcome to attend, and might first like to check out the tutorial [3].</p><p>[1] &ldquo;PEtab‚ Interoperable specification of parameter estimation problems in systems biology&rdquo; <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008646>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008646</a>

What are the specific needs for annotation of &ldquo;logical&rdquo; models (sometimes known as Boolean models)? In this breakout session, we&rsquo;ll look at some example SBML-Qual models, especially gene regulatory networks. The specific augmentations that SBML-qual provides over &ldquo;plain&rdquo; SBML means that there are new opportunities to provide specific types of annotations on elements. As with any annotation effort, we will discuss tool support and ways to make annotation semi-automatic or easier for the modeler. We will also discuss how in-line annotations might look within SBML-qual, versus a separate file (per the COMBINE community recommendation).</p><hr><p><b>A COMBINE Standard for Digital Twins of Living System?</b>Rahuman Sheriff (European Bioinformatics Institute, EMBL-EBI)<br>Digital Twins are highly accurate and dynamic virtual replicas of real-world systems that has revolutionized a wide range of engineering industry. However, as this paradigm shift extends its reach into the realm of healthcare and medicine, including the ambitious endeavour of creating a human digital twin, it becomes evident that a standardized approach is imperative.</p><p>The COmputational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) community, renowned for its development of critical standards such as SBML, CellML, SEDML, and PETab, now faces a pivotal question: Can it deliver a standardized specification for Digital Twins of patients, encompassing the complexities of human biology and beyond?</p><p>In this engaging breakout session, we will explore this compelling proposition. Together, we will delve into the pressing need for a COMBINE standard tailored to the model human Digital Twins. In this session, we will engage in discussion, debating the feasibility and implications of developing a universal standard for Digital Twins that promises to shape the future of personalised medicine. If the outcome of the discussion is positive, we could consider writing a white paper on this topic.</p><h3 id=a-nametutorialsatutorialsh3><a name=tutorials></a>Tutorials</h3></h3><p><b>Biological and Biophysics Simulation in Tissue Forge: Introduction and Guided Simulation Building</b> T.J.

NERDSS (<a href=https://github.com/mjohn218/NERDSS>https://github.com/mjohn218/NERDSS</a>) is a nonequilibrium reaction-diffusion self-assembly simulator that integrates molecular structures and their processes to understand the dynamics of cellular processes that last for minutes (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.05.002)>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.05.002)</a>. It allows users to build a reaction-diffusion model based on actual molecular structures, which enhances the model&rsquo;s accuracy and captures the complexities of multisubunit complexes and their reversible formation. Several case studies have employed NERDSS, such as the formation and spontaneous disassembly of large clathrin lattices (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009969),>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009969),</a> the dynamic behavior of the HIV Gag lattice in virions (<a href=https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84881),>https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84881),</a> and understanding the temporal influence of cofactors in retroviral Gag lattice assembly (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.06.021)>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.06.021)</a>. During the session, we will explore these applications, demonstrating the software&rsquo;s versatility in handling diverse cellular processes. The session will cover core principles of structure-resolved reaction-diffusion, emphasizing its role in cellular biology. We will attempt to build a coarse-grained structure from the real protein structure from the pdb database. Then, we will learn how to set up a model, run the model with NERDSS, analyze and visualize the model outcomes with io_nerdss (<a href=https://github.com/mjohn218/io_nerdss>https://github.com/mjohn218/io_nerdss</a>) and OVITO.</p><hr><p><b>Tutorial on biological modeling with PySB</b> Mustafa Ozen Ryan Spangler, Carlos F. Lopez (Altos Labs)<br>PySB (Python Systems Biology) is a powerful and versatile biological modeling tool that has gained prominence in systems biology.

Trying not to reinvent (much of) the wheel, it uses modern Python syntax to define and compose models in a compact way. This allows us to take advantage of the huge investment on tooling from the broader Python community such as static type checkers, code linters and formatters, autocomplete and refactoring features from IDEs, among others.<p>Using standard libraries from the PyData ecosystem, by default, poincare compiles into a first-order ODE system using NumPy arrays, and uses solvers from SciPy. But it also provides different backends such as Numba, which compiles just-in-time to LLVM code, providing a significant speed boost, or JAX, which provides autodifferentiation tools targeted for ML. Additionally, it supports units using the Pint library.</p><p>SimBio is built on top of poincaré, adding some components for reaction-based models used in systems biology. It provides some predefined building blocks for the most common reactions, but allows easily to create your own. Finally, it implements an importer and exporter to SBML, allowing to interexchange models with the COMBINE community. We hope that it is simple enough for beginners, but powerful for power-users with the possibility to extend and compose with the large Python ecosystem.</p><hr><p><b>DySE: Dynamic System Explanation framework</b>
Difei Tang (University of Pittsbrugh); Natasa Miskov-Zivanov (University of Pittsburgh)<br>In this demo, we will showcase our framework, DySE (Dynamic System Explanation), that includes tools for model simulation, model extension, interaction classification, interaction filtering, model checking, and sensitivity analysis. The rapid proliferation of data generated by experiments studying biological systems poses a considerable challenge. This overflow of information is spread across an array of publishing platforms, making it increasingly difficult to manually analyze all available data. This underscores the necessity for automated methods that can retrieve and connect relevant pieces of this voluminous knowledge. Such methods are crucial for understanding, explaining, and predicting the behavior of these complex systems.</p><p>To tackle this challenge, DySE integrates machine reading, automated model assembly, and computational analysis to enhance understanding and explanation of complex systems. The toolset is conveniently accessible via a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).</p><p>FLUTE utilizes existing databases to evaluate confidence and trustworthiness of given biochemical interactions (<a href=https://tinyurl.com/flutedoc)>https://tinyurl.com/flutedoc)</a>. VIOLIN classifies large sets of interactions with respect to a given model. The interactions are classified into four main categories, corroborations, contradictions, extensions, and flagged, and several subcategories within main ones (<a href=https://tinyurl.com/violindoc)>https://tinyurl.com/violindoc)</a>. CLARINET (see <a href=https://tinyurl.com/clarinetdoc>https://tinyurl.com/clarinetdoc</a> and link to binder notebook on main page) and ACCORDION (see <a href=https://tinyurl.com/accordiondoc>https://tinyurl.com/accordiondoc</a> and link to binder notebook on main page) automatically expand and recommend models based on selected desired model properties.</p><p>In conjunction with these front-end tools, we&rsquo;ve also developed back-end tools within the DySE framework. DiSH is a stochastic simulator offering versatile simulation schemes and timing options (<a href=https://tinyurl.com/dishjupyter)>https://tinyurl.com/dishjupyter)</a>. PIANO provides comprehensive sensitivity analysis for the entire model, and allows for identifying most influential pathways and suggesting interventions (<a href=https://tinyurl.com/pianojupyter)>https://tinyurl.com/pianojupyter)</a>. Additionally, we&rsquo;ve introduced a unified format compatible with the tools mentioned above: BioRECIPE (<a href=https://tinyurl.com/biorecipe),>https://tinyurl.com/biorecipe),</a> seamlessly translating to and from widely used synthetic biology modeling languages.</p><p>All of these tools can be used either independently or in combination. For instance, synthetic biologists can rely on it to ensure the reliability of interactions in designing synthetic biological systems. Bioinformaticians can efficiently filter and prioritize data, while computational modelers benefit from model extensions to always get model up-to-date. Professionals in biotech industries utilize sensitivity analysis for optimizing therapies. Additionally, even educators would find it valuable when using simulation software.</p><hr><p><b>Novel advances in the automation of knowledge selection and model assembly</b> Natasa Miskov-Zivanov, Yasmine Ahmed, Gaoxiang Zhou (University of Pittsburgh)<br>Creating computational models of complicated systems, including intracellular and intercellular bionetworks, is a time and labor-intensive task which is often limited by the knowledge and experience of Pathway database modelers. This has naturally led to the emergence of the idea of automating the process of building new/extending existing models, which could have a significant potential in enabling rapid, consistent, comprehensive and robust analysis of complicated systems. Inspired by this idea, we propose in this work different novel approaches namely ACCORDION (ACCelerating and Optimizing model RecommenDatIONs) and CLARINET (CLARifying NETworks) for expanding models using the information extracted from literature by machine reading engines. Our proposed approaches combine machine reading with clustering, and graph theoretical analysis to create an automated framework for efficient model assembly. Furthermore, by automatically extending models with the information published in literature, our proposed methods allow for collecting the existing information in a consistent and comprehensive way. This, in turn, facilitates information reuse, data reproducibility, and replacing hundreds/thousands of manual experiments, thereby reducing the time needed for the advancement of knowledge. To evaluate ACCORDION1 and CLARINET, we compare their outcomes with three previously published manually created models namely naive T cell differentiation model, T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia model and pancreatic cancer cell model. Besides demonstrating automated reconstruction of a model that was previously built manually, our tools can assemble multiple models that satisfy desired system properties. As such, they replace large number of tedious or even impractical manual experiments and guide alternative hypotheses and interventions in biological systems.
A GitHub page, ReadtheDocs and Jupyter notebook are available for ACCORDION <a href=http://www.nmzlab.pitt.edu/accordion>http://www.nmzlab.pitt.edu/accordion</a> and CLARINET <a href=http://www.nmzlab.pitt.edu/clarinet>http://www.nmzlab.pitt.edu/clarinet</a>.</p><hr><p><b>Using Compucell3D as a Platform for Model Building to Explore Intracellular Pathways, Cell Behaviors, Cell-Cell Interactions and Tissue-Level Signaling</b> Pedro Dal-Castel (Biocomplexity Institute and Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Indiana University)<br></p><p>Mechanistic agent-based modeling is an integral part of contemporary bioscience, used for hypothesis generation and testing, experiment design and interpretation, and the design of therapeutic interventions. The CompuCell3D (CC3D) modeling environment allows researchers to rapidly build and execute complex virtual tissue simulations with minimal programming experience. CC3D enables biological simulations from subcellular to tissue scales, supporting explicit cell shapes, cell migration, contact-mediated cell interactions, soluble signals, and complex cell state dynamics (gene regulatory, signaling, and metabolic networks).

If you plan on participating, please fill out this form: <a href=https://forms.gle/TTnw88hR3PebCkmE7>https://forms.gle/TTnw88hR3PebCkmE7</a></p><p>Learning Outcomes: Ability to use CompuCell3D to design, execute and explore virtual-tissue simulations integrating cells, networks and external chemical fields. For more information: see <a href=https://www.compucell3d.org>https://www.compucell3d.org</a> or contact <a href=mailto:pdalcastel@gmail.com>pdalcastel@gmail.com</a>, or <a href=mailto:jaglazier@gmail.com>jaglazier@gmail.com</a></p><p>Computer Requirements: Any Windows or Mac computer. CompuCell3D is open-source and free. It also runs on many LINUX deployments (see <a href=http://www.compucell3d.org>www.compucell3d.org</a> for details). Our preferred method for this miniworkshop is a local installation of CC3D in your machine. However, it can also be launched as a nanoHUB application, which runs in a browser without local installation (open your account in nanoHUB at <a href=https://nanohub.org/register/)>https://nanohub.org/register/)</a>.</p><h2><a href=https://forms.gle/7pbiYps84yUvEbsY9 target=_blank rel=noopener><span style=color:#8dc742>Registration</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2>Registration for the meeting is free.
